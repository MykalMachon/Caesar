# Caesar üçπ
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) web server that handles "heavy" tasks asynchronously via [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/index.html).

## Why did you make this?
Another project I was working on needed to be able to crunch a bunch of data, and email a report out. 
Requests to the route using this function were sluggish, so I wanted to implement a task-queue in Flask, and this was the easiest solution I found. 

## When would you want this?
1. When dealing with mass email sends / a high volume of singular email sends
2. When doing large multi-step operations like deleting a large number of records or preparing a data export
3. etc, etc, etc.
